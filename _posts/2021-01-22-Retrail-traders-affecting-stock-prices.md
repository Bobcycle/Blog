There have been numerous of times where I have used the argument to use the interest of retail traders (your average joe) as an indicator to liquidate or not.

*In the year 1929, [Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy_Sr.) sold all of his stock just before the marekt crash of that year. He got out of the market because he received stock tips from a shoe-shine boy.*

If your grandparents or others in your vicinty talk about stocks (who normally don't) this could be a good *indication* to sell your stocks as a reversal may be likely.

It is a genuine indicator to consider for anyone who does analysis stocks.

The University of Berkeley has researched this exact phenomenon. In 2009 they have published their study about the potential of retail traders being able to affect stock prices.

In this case, their conclusion was that over short time horizons (days or weeks) retail traders have a direct influence on the market, pushing or pulling prices.

> Over short horizons, such as days or week, retail trades move stock prices in the direction of their trades.

When we look at a longer time horizons (yearly), retail traders have an influence, however, particularly on smaller capitalized stocks.

Retail traders do move markets over any timeframe, however the smaller the timeframe and the smaller the cap of the stock, the more influentual they are.
