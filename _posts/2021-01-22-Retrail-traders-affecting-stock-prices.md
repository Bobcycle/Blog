Retrail traders affecting stock prices

There have been numerous of times where I have used the argument to use the interest of retail traders (your average joe) as an indicator to liquidate or not.

*In the year 1929, [Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy_Sr.) sold all of his stock. He got out of the market because he received stock tips from a shoe-shine boy.*

If your grandparents or others in your vicinty talk about stocks (who normally don't) this could be a good *indication* to sell your stocks as it may be overvalued.

It is a genuine indicator to consider for anyone who does analysis stocks.

However, do note that trading is odd based. Acting upon this single indicator would be foolish. The key is to get confirmation from multiple elements.

The University of Berkeley has researched this exact phenomenon as laid out above. In 2009 they have published their in-depth study about the potential of retail traders being able to affect stock prices.

In this case, their conclusion was that over short time horizons (days or weeks) retail traders have a direct influence on the market, pushing or pulling prices.

> Over short horizons, such as days or week, retail trades move stock prices in the direction of their trades.

When we look at a longer time horizons (yearly), retail traders only have a direct influence on small cap stocks and not mid-large cap.

> Over long horizons like a year, the retail trades move only the prices of small stocks in the direction of their trade. In combination the contemporaneous price moves and subsequent reversals suggest that retail trades move marketsâ€”particularly among small stocks, where the trades of retail investors are most likely to be influential.
