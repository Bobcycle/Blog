title: Trading is serious !@#$%

---

If you meet someone without a trading plan who does not have substantial experience within the financial market I urge everyone to run as fast as you can from them.

Why do I feel so strongly about this? Trading is entirely odd based. If you do not have a strategy, you are literally gambling. Consistency is key in this industry. Measure, analyze and adapt.

*Note that this only directed to those who call themselves traders.*

They say that every trader blows up their account before seeing actual success. It is not a badge of honor. Anyone account being blown up could have been prevented.

Prevented by having a strategy, risk management and post analysis of trades taken.

I'm in that phase but, fortunately didn't blow up my account. I made some stupid trades out of emotion as I thought I know what I am doing. Note that I am the one who setup a full fledged strategy, made shirts saying "Trading without gambling is rules" and tells everyone what I said in the opening of this post. It means nothing if you don't stick to your trading plan.

Am I disappointed in myself? Sure. However, it is the tipping moment of my trading career. I can say it all I want without actually experiencing substantial loss but it will never hit home if it doesn't happen to yourself. This has saved me dough in the long run.

There is some serious bull traders have to put up with. Initially when I started I thought it would be an easy thing to do from home. I scoff at that. It is probably the hardest thing I will do in my entire life. The market just is and you're on your own.

1. Make sure your entries are fully protected.
2. Take your stop losses and do not touch them.
3. You can't adjust your take profit during trades.
4. If you need time off, take it to relax or study.
5. Do not overtrade or revenge trade.
6. Measure, analyze and adapt.
