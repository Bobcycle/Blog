title: Trading is serious !@#$%

---

If you meet someone without a trading plan who does not have substantial experience within the financial market (and trades actively) I urge everyone to run.

Why do I feel so strongly about this? Trading is entirely odd based. If you do not have a strategy, you are literally gambling. Consistency is key in this industry.

They say that every trader blows up their account before seeing actual success. It is not a badge of honor. Anyone account being blown up could have been prevented.

*Prevented by having a strategy, risk management and post analysis of trades taken.*

I'm in that phase but, fortunately didn't blow up my account. I made some stupid trades out of emotion as I thought I know what I am doing. Note that I am the one who setup a full fledged strategy, made shirts saying "Trading without gambling is rules" and tells everyone what I said in the opening of this post. It means nothing if you don't stick to your trading plan.

Am I disappointed in myself? Sure. However, it's the tipping moment of my trading career. I can say it all I want without actually experiencing substantial loss but it will never hit home if it doesn't happen to myself. This has saved me dough in the long run.

*If you think less of yourself after doing it... don't do it again.*

There is some serious bull traders have to put up with. Initially when I started I thought it would be an easy thing to do from home. I scoff at that. It is probably the hardest thing I will do in my entire life. The market just is and it will take your money without mercy.
