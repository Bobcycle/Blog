title: S&P 500 Distribution and odds calculation
---

It is important to be able to gather data yourself without relying on sources. My good friend going by the name "Turtle" once told me that I am basically a one trick pony as I thoroughly focus on technical analysis provided by third parties. What happens if I don't have access?

This made me think and ultimately made me enroll in a program with the Institute of Trading and portfolio management. I've been taught on how to make a distribution and odds calculation paired with creating my own volatility assessment of any asset class as a result.
