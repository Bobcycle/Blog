Your risk can increase even when you're doing nothing. If the average market volatility is 0,50% with a $1.000.000 portfolio, you will either win or lose 5000$ a day. If the market volatility is double (1%) you can either win or lose 10.000$ a day. 

You have increased your risk by doing nothing.
Market volatility is the change of prices per a given time period.

The only way to do combat this is by halving your exposure ($1.000.000) to the market. You have to sell half of your position which makes your exposure $500.000.
