title: Volatility index

Institutions use the VIX to measure the stress and risk in the market. It indicates market volatility over the coming 30 days by averaging call and put option prices.

Before the market opens, institutions always mention the VIX during their daily meetings. Anything above 20 is considered high. If it is above 20 the manager may instruct market participants to lower their exposure to manage risk.
