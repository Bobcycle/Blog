title: Volatility index (fear indicator)
---

The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) a.k.a. the fear indicator is a real-time market index which represents the expected market volatility (price movement) over the coming 30 days.

Institutions use the VIX to measure the stress and risk in the market. It indicates market volatility over the coming 30 days by averaging call and put option prices. If the VIX is up substantially it would mean more volatility, meaning that investors have to cut their exposure to manage risk.

If the average market volatility is 0.50% on an asset with a $1.000.000 portfolio you will either win or lose $5.000 a day during normal market volatility.

(1.000.000 x 0,005 = 5.000)â €

However, if for some reason the market volatility doubles (1.0%) you are automatically prone to lose double the amount. You have now increased your risk by 100% by doing nothing.

The average level of the VIX is around 15-16. In 2020, the average was 29.25 which marks the start of the COVID pandemic. In almost all cases, a high VIX is correlated to a price decrease. I've been able to open some charts and provide a real-world example.

**Calculation**

The VIX is calculated using a formula to gather expected volatility by averaging prices of OTM (out of the money) puts and calls. will spare you the actual calculation, but for Fantine... [here](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/futures/vixwhite.pdf) you can find the actual whitepaper which goes in-depth in regards to how it's calculated.
