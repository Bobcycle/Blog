title: Liquidity crisis
---

I wasn't quite sure what to think when the brokers stopped allowing buy orders and only sell orders on Thursday the 28th of January. Well... we could have a very bad day.

The bottom line is, if the share price of Gamestop is sent to mars, it would cause a meltdown throughout the board where even the custodian may have to raise capital.

It would set off a chain reaction of institutions being forced to sell off unrelated positions to answer the margin call of those who are short on Gamestop and it would cause the *entire* market to plummet.

**Here is how it works**

Whenever you place a trade, it goes through your broker. Then your broker contacts another party, which contacts another (the DTCC) to issue you the share from a seller.

It is important to know that for every share you buy there will be a seller. If those sellers go bankrupt they can not deliver your share which means that the clearing house has to deliver your share out of pocket. If the share price goes to $1000 the clearing house just wouldn't have enough liquidity to cover that. 

Which means that we're now talking about a liquidity crisis.
