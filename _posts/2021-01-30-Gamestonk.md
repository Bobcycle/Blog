I wasn't quite sure what to think when the brokers stopped allowing buy orders and only sell orders on Thursday the 28th of January. Well... we could have a very bad day.

The bottom line is, if the share price of Gamestop is sent to mars, it would cause a meltdown throughout the board where even the custodian may have to raise capital.

It would set off a chain reaction of institutions being forced to sell off unrelated positions to answer the [margin call](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) of those who are short on Gamestop and it would cause the *entire* market to plummet like a house of cards like for a few days as hedge funds would go bankrupt.

**Here is what's going on**
Whenever you place a buy order, your broker does not know who the seller is. Therefore both the buyer and seller use a third party called the DTCC to match and clear the stock transaction, moving the title from the selling broker to the buying broker.

*This explanation has been greatly simplified in the interest of brevity.*

This clearing process takes T+2 in this case. The settlement (moving the share from selling to buying broker) takes no more than two days from the trade. However... for the buyer and seller the transaction is reflected immediately. Behind the scenes, there is lending.

Whenever there is lending, there is risk from the other side to not pay up.

In this case the DTCC provides their liquidity (their dough) to guarantee settlement, but their balance sheet isn't that big so there are rules in place. 

Under here a summary of what happens upon execution:

1. You place a buy order for a stock of your choice.
2. The broker sends the money to DTCC.
3. DTCC sends to money to the broker to buy the share.
4. Settlement (T+2) happens within 2 days.

Let's say you deposit a few thousand dollars in your broker account in order to open a margin account and buy a stock such as $GME as example. Technically, you don't own the stock and is under the name of your broker. Why it is this way can have its own blogpost.

When you signed the customer agreement you gave the broker the ability to take the stock you bought and lend it out to others to short under a margin account. You now think you own the shares, even though you never did as it is a margin account. The broker lends your shares out.

Your broker lends the shares out which creates a credit line between your broker and another party. Now you have a stock credited to your name, instead of owning it.

What happens if the institution who borrowed your stock to go short on can't pay up if $GME goes up 500 USD and goes bankrupt?
